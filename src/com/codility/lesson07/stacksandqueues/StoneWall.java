/**
 * 
 * You are going to build a stone wall. The wall should be straight and N meters
 * long, and its thickness should be constant; however, it should have different
 * heights in different places. The height of the wall is specified by an array
 * H of N positive integers. H[I] is the height of the wall from I to I+1 meters
 * to the right of its left end. In particular, H[0] is the height of the wall's
 * left end and H[Nâˆ’1] is the height of the wall's right end.
 * 
 * The wall should be built of cuboid stone blocks (that is, all sides of such
 * blocks are rectangular). Your task is to compute the minimum number of blocks
 * needed to build the wall.
 * 
 * Write a function:
 * 
 * class Solution { public int solution(int[] H); }
 * 
 * that, given an array H of N positive integers specifying the height of the
 * wall, returns the minimum number of blocks needed to build it.
 * 
 * For example, given array H containing N = 9 integers:
 * 
 * - H[0] = 8 
 * - H[1] = 8 
 * - H[2] = 5 
 * - H[3] = 7 
 * - H[4] = 9 
 * - H[5] = 8 
 * - H[6] = 7 
 * - H[7] = 4 
 * - H[8] = 8 
 * 
 * the function should return 7. The figure shows one possible arrangement
 * of seven blocks.
 * 
 * Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
 * 
 * - N is an integer within the range [1..100,000]; 
 * - each element of array H is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000].
